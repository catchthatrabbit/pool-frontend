Frontend for Catch That Rabbit pool

## Getting started

### NVM

Before staring "npm install" please compare your Node version with .nvmrc file.
To switch node version use Node Version Manager https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
After installation just open the project and write "nvm use" in your terminal to use version specified in .nvmrc. If you does not have a required version of Node - "nvm install v{version}" will help you.

### Install packages

Run `npm install` on the project directory to install dependencies.

Then run `npm run dev` to start the project and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
