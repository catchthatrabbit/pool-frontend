# CTR Pool frontend

Frontend for Catch That Rabbit pool developed in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before starting `npm install` please, compare your Node version with the .nvmrc file.

To switch node versions, use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or your preferred method.

After installation, just open the project and write `nvm use` in your terminal to use the version specified in `.nvmrc`.

If you do not have the required version of the Node - `nvm install v{version}` will help you.

### Installation

You can use your preferred package manager, such as `yarn`, `npm`, `npx`.

- Install the dependencies with `yarn` or `npm i`
